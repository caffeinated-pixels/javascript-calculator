# JavaScript Calculator

My React-based app for the [Build a JavaScript Calculator](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator) freeCodeCamp project. I setup this version using create-react-app.

## Goals

- use React & Sass
- mobile-first responsive design
- grid container for keypad

## To-do list

- set-up a basic calculator structure
- decide on whether to use either:
  - immediate execution logic
  - formula/expression logic (probably this!!!)
- handle & display number input
- store operands and operators in string (state)
- deal with incomplete decimals, eg "0.", "1.", etc
- deal with sequential operators
- perform calculation based on formula string
- formula display
- digit limit
- math symbols for operators on display
- simple styling of elements
- make pretty

## Stretch goals

- keyboard input
- del/backspace key
- comma separation of digits
- without using eval
